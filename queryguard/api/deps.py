"""Dependency providers for the API layer.

Routes declare what they need with ``Depends`` instead of importing it, which is
what makes the pipeline swappable at the edge: a test overrides
:func:`get_analysis_runner` through ``app.dependency_overrides`` to inject a runner
with a narrower rule set, a fixed run ID, or a deliberate failure, without patching
module globals.

Clients, settings, and database handles land here as the stages that need them are
implemented.
