"""Stage 1 (diff) — turn a pull request's changed files into sources to analyze.

Pure, and deliberately so: nothing here opens a socket. GitHub access lives in
:mod:`queryguard.integrations.github`, which hands this module
:class:`~queryguard.models.diff.ChangedFile` values and a way to read head-side
text. That is what makes the whole of stage 1 testable from the recorded payload
in ``tests/fixtures/diffs/`` with no network and no credentials.

Why a source carries the *whole head file* rather than the patch
----------------------------------------------------------------

The obvious implementation reconstructs each file from its patch — take the
context and added lines, drop the removed ones — and hands the extractor that.
It is tempting because it needs no second request, and it is wrong, because a
patch is not a program. QueryGuard's fixture pull request demonstrates the
failure exactly: a hunk adds the derived method ``findByStatusAndCustomerId`` to
``OrderRepository``, but the line declaring ``interface OrderRepository`` is
thirty lines above the hunk and so is not in the patch. The Java extractor finds
derived methods *inside a repository interface*, so a reconstructed source would
have quietly reported nothing about a query the pull request had just added. The
same holds for SQL that references a table created earlier in the migration, and
for anything else whose meaning depends on text the author did not touch.

So the content is the file as it stands at the head commit, in full, and the
hunks ride alongside it in
:attr:`~queryguard.models.query.SourceFile.hunks`. Two things follow, and both
are the point:

- **Line numbers need no translation.** Line *n* of the content is line *n* of
  the head file, so a finding anchored where the extractor found it already
  points at the pull request's own file rather than at the base. There is no
  offset arithmetic to get wrong, because there is no offset.
- **"Was this line touched?" is still answerable**, through
  :meth:`~queryguard.models.query.SourceFile.is_changed`. Deciding what to *do*
  with that answer — report only on changed lines, or report everything and rank
  changed lines higher — is the report stage's call, so this stage records the
  hunks and drops nothing.
