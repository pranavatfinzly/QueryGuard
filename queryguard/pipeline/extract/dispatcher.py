"""Stage 2 — route one source file to the extractor that understands it.

This module is deliberately almost empty, and that is the point. Adding a
language means writing an :class:`~queryguard.pipeline.extract.base.Extractor`
and registering it; nothing here changes, because nothing here names a language
except the two registration lines below. The stage's input and output contracts
(``SourceFile`` in, ``list[ExtractedQuery]`` out) are fixed regardless of how
many languages exist, so no downstream stage can tell the difference between a
run over ``.sql`` files and a run over a polyglot diff.
