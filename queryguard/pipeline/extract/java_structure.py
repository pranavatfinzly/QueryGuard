"""Stage 7 (structure) — read Java control flow, types, and call sites.

What this is, and what it deliberately is not
---------------------------------------------

N+1 detection needs facts a query extractor never has to establish: which
identifier holds a repository, which construct repeats, and whether a call sits
inside it. That is program structure, so this module reads program structure and
nothing else. It knows what a loop is; it does not know what a query is, and it
never decides that anything is a problem. Judgement lives in
:mod:`queryguard.pipeline.nplusone`.

It is not a Java parser, and the distinction matters enough to state plainly.
It tokenizes :attr:`~queryguard.pipeline.extract.java_source.JavaSource.structure`
— the view with comments *and* string-literal bodies blanked — and walks brace
structure with real bracket matching. Two consequences follow directly, and both
are load-bearing for a review bot:

* Java written inside a comment or a string literal cannot produce a call site, a
  loop, or a repository. It is not there to be matched.
* A brace inside a literal does not open or close a block, so a method body's
  extent is its real extent.

What it cannot do is resolve types it was never shown. A receiver whose declaring
interface is outside the pull request is resolved by import path when the caller
supplies a way to read it, and otherwise falls back to
:attr:`~queryguard.models.java_structure.RepositoryResolution.NAME_CONVENTION`,
which the detector treats as weaker evidence rather than as proof.

Why lexical rather than a parser
--------------------------------

``javalang`` was evaluated and rejected: its grammar is Java 8 and its last
release was 2020, so records, text blocks, ``var``, sealed types, and switch
expressions — ordinary in the JDK 17/21 services this must read — would fail to
parse, turning a real N+1 into silence. ``tree-sitter-java`` is the technically
correct answer and remains the migration target, as does the JavaParser sidecar
CLAUDE.md's tech-stack table names. Neither is a dependency today.

The boundary that makes either swap cheap is
:mod:`queryguard.models.java_structure`: this module's whole output is those
models, and the detector reads only those models. Replacing the analyzer means
producing the same contracts from a parse tree.

Known limits, all of which the detector is written to tolerate:

* Overload resolution is by name only — Java's argument-type dispatch is not
  modelled, so two overloads of one repository method are one method here.
* Alias tracking is deliberately shallow (see :func:`_local_handles`). Anything
  beyond a direct assignment from a known handle is not followed, because an
  unsound alias analysis produces confident nonsense.
* A method reference (``repo::findById``) is not read as a call. Whether it runs
  per element depends on what consumes it, which is not visible here.

    2. **Targeted retrieval.** For a receiver whose type is still unknown, the
       declaring file is fetched by import path when ``resolve_source`` allows it.
       Only types actually used as receivers are fetched, never the repository —
       a pull request touching two services must not pull a thousand files.
    3. **Resolution.** Call sites, iteration contexts, and lazy accesses, now
       against everything the first two passes established.

    Failing to resolve is never fatal: an unresolved type keeps its call sites,
    marked ``NAME_CONVENTION``, and is named in ``unresolved_types``.
