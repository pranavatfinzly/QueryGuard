"""Schema context for rules that need to know what the database looks like.

Most static rules are self-contained: ``SELECT *`` is a ``SELECT *`` whatever the
schema. Two are not — a predicate is only "unindexed" relative to a real set of
indexes, and a cast is only implicit relative to a real column type.

The lookup is deliberately stubbed for now. :data:`UNKNOWN_SCHEMA` answers "I do
not know" to everything, and rules that depend on it must then stay silent. That
asymmetry is the point: a rule with no schema must produce no findings rather than
guess, because "no index on that column" is unfalsifiable without the schema and
would fire on every query in the diff.

:class:`StaticSchemaProvider` is the real implementation for tests and for the
eventual caller in ``db/snapshot.py``, which will build one from the schema dump.
