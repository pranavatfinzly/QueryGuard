"""Stage 3 — shared readings of a sqlglot AST.

Questions more than one rule has to answer, answered once. Two rules previously
carried their own copies of the alias resolution below, written slightly
differently; a rule asking "which table is this column on?" and getting a
different answer depending on which file it lives in is a bug waiting for the
third copy.

These are *readings*, not checks: each takes an AST and returns a fact about it,
with no notion of severity, findings, or provenance. That is what keeps them
reusable and what keeps :mod:`queryguard.pipeline.static_rules.base` to the
protocol and registry it is named for.
