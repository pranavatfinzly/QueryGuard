"""Diff contracts — what a pull request looks like before it becomes sources.

Stage 1 has two halves that are worth keeping apart. One is *what GitHub said*: a
list of changed paths, each with a status and a patch. The other is *what the
pipeline will read*: a list of :class:`~queryguard.models.query.SourceFile`. This
module holds the first, so that the conversion between them is a pure function
over models instead of a function over whatever shape PyGithub happens to return
this release.

That separation is what lets the whole of stage 1 be tested from a recorded
payload with no network: :class:`ChangedFile` is the seam, and
``tests/fixtures/diffs/`` is a real one filled in.
