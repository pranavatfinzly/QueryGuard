"""N+1 contracts — the deterministic evidence, separate from its prose.

Stage 7 produces two different kinds of thing and they must not be confused. One
is a set of *facts*: a call site at a line, inside a loop, on a type that extends
a Spring Data interface, with the loop variable flowing into its arguments. The
other is an *explanation* a reviewer reads. The facts are established by static
analysis and are checkable; the prose is written to make them land.

:class:`NPlusOneCandidate` is the first of those, and it is the whole input the
LLM stage is ever given. That is what makes CLAUDE.md's rule enforceable rather
than aspirational — a model cannot invent a loop that is not in the candidate,
because deciding what the loops are is not a step it participates in. It can only
describe what is already here, and
:func:`queryguard.integrations.claude.reconcile_nplusone_explanation` checks that
it did.

:class:`EvidenceTier` is the other half of the discipline. Confidence here is not
a number someone tuned; it is a statement of which evidence was actually
obtained, and every tier names a combination a reader can verify.
