"""Java structural contracts — what the N+1 stage reads instead of raw source.

Stage 7 asks questions no single query can answer: *is this repository call
executed once per element of something?* Answering it needs control flow, type
resolution, and call sites — none of which
:class:`~queryguard.models.query.ExtractedQuery` carries, and none of which
belong on it. A query is a query wherever it was written; a call site is a fact
about a program.

So the structural facts live here, in their own contracts, and the detector reads
these rather than Java text. That boundary is the point of the module. The
analyzer behind it is lexical today (see
:mod:`queryguard.pipeline.extract.java_structure` for what that can and cannot
see); replacing it with tree-sitter or the JavaParser sidecar CLAUDE.md plans for
means producing these same models from a real parse tree, and the detector does
not change. A detector written against Java text instead would have to be
rewritten with the parser.

Everything here is immutable, like every other stage contract, and everything
carries provenance: a structural claim a reviewer cannot locate in their own file
is a claim they cannot check.
