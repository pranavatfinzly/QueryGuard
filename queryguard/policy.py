"""Deterministic merge-enforcement policy for QueryGuard findings.

This module is the sole authority for turning a completed :class:`Report` into
one of four outcomes — :class:`EnforcementStatus` — and, for ``BLOCKED``,
which findings are the reason. It deliberately has no dependency on report
rendering or LLM providers: prose is useful to a reviewer, but cannot change
whether a pull request is blocked (CLAUDE.md: "Findings from Claude [or Groq]
are claims, not facts" — and, more directly, an LLM-authored explanation has
no field in :class:`~queryguard.models.finding.Finding` it could use to talk
its way out of a severity it was given).

Status semantics, matching the task's PASS/BLOCKED/DEGRADED/FAILED contract:

- **BLOCKED** — checked first, if a blocking finding exists. Takes priority
  over every other status, including FAILED: a real ``galaxy-payment`` run
  surfaced the case this ordering exists for — the changed files were Java
  services with no ``@Query``/derived methods of their own, so extraction's
  ``queries`` list was empty, while N+1 detection (which reads control flow,
  not query declarations) still found a genuine blocking finding, and posting
  the review then failed. Zero queries plus a degraded stage is
  indistinguishable from a total ingestion failure by shape alone — but a
  finding existing at all is proof some analysis was reliable, so BLOCKED
  must not be buried under FAILED.
- **FAILED** — otherwise, if no reliable analysis was possible at all. Reuses
  the same signal :func:`queryguard.pipeline.report.render_markdown`'s own
  summary already keys its "QueryGuard could not analyze this pull request"
  wording on: zero queries, zero findings, *and* at least one degraded stage.
  Zero queries with zero degraded stages is a clean, ordinary result (a
  README-only pull request), not a failure — the two must not read the same.
- **DEGRADED** — otherwise, if any stage failed soft (``report.degraded_stages``
  non-empty). A Groq failure never reaches this: a missing LLM explanation is
  invisible at the ``Finding``/``Report`` level (CLAUDE.md invariant 5's Groq
  clause is independent of this status by construction, not by a special
  case here).
- **PASS** — otherwise.
