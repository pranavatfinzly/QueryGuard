"""The provider-neutral LLM boundary: what any explanation provider may see and say.

This is where CLAUDE.md's rule about LLM findings being *claims, not facts* becomes
enforceable code rather than a convention every provider has to remember on its own.
Two things live here, and every provider — Groq today, Claude or anything else
later — is built on top of them rather than reimplementing them:

* :func:`build_nplusone_request` — the structured payload a provider is shown.
  Only established facts, each labelled with how it was established.
* :func:`reconcile_nplusone_explanation` — the merge that lets prose *describe* a
  finding without ever letting it *move* one. Every deterministic field on the
  :class:`~queryguard.models.finding.Finding` survives untouched; the model may
  only add a sentence ahead of the detector's own explanation and suggestions
  after the ones the detector already derived.

:class:`LLMExplanationProvider` is the seam a caller drives against.  It is a
:class:`typing.Protocol`, not a base class, so nothing has to inherit from it —
:class:`queryguard.integrations.groq.GroqExplanationProvider` satisfies it today
by having the right method, and a future ``ClaudeExplanationProvider`` built on
:mod:`queryguard.integrations.claude` would satisfy it the same way. The stage that
drives one (:func:`queryguard.pipeline.nplusone.detect_n_plus_one`) is written
against this Protocol and against nothing else, which is what makes swapping the
provider a change to *one* call site rather than to the detector.

Nothing in this module makes a network call. A provider decides how to obtain an
:class:`~queryguard.models.nplusone.NPlusOneExplanation`; this module only decides
what it is allowed to do once it has one.

You are an explanation layer for QueryGuard, an automated database-query reviewer.

The deterministic analysis supplied by the application is authoritative. You are \
given structured evidence about one candidate N+1 query pattern that a static \
analyzer already found: a call site, a loop, a repository method, and whatever a \
runtime statement log corroborated.

You MUST NOT invent facts. You MUST ONLY use facts present in the supplied \
evidence. You MUST NOT change or introduce:
- severity
- confidence
- file
- line
- query identity
- execution count
- runtime evidence
- detection status (whether this is or is not an N+1 — that has already been decided)

If the supplied evidence contains no runtime section, no query was observed \
running: describe the pattern as a *potential* N+1 pattern, never as a measured \
one. Do not say a query "executed", "ran", or "fired" any number of times. If a \
runtime section is present, you may describe what it recorded, using only the \
numbers supplied.

Respond with a JSON object with exactly these fields: `summary` (one sentence \
naming the pattern), `why_it_matters` (the performance consequence, grounded in \
the supplied evidence), `evidence_explanation` (what the supplied evidence shows \
and how it supports the finding), and `recommendation` (a concrete remediation). \
Every sentence must be traceable to a fact you were given — do not add anything \
that is not in the supplied evidence.\
