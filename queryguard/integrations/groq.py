"""Groq-backed :class:`~queryguard.integrations.llm.LLMExplanationProvider`.

Groq does not decide whether an N+1 exists — the detector in
:mod:`queryguard.pipeline.nplusone` already has, deterministically, before this
module is ever reached. Groq's only job is to turn one already-established
:class:`~queryguard.models.nplusone.NPlusOneCandidate` into developer-facing
prose: what was found, why it matters, what the evidence shows, and what to do
about it. It cannot relocate a finding, invent a measurement, or change a
severity, because :class:`~queryguard.models.nplusone.NPlusOneExplanation` — the
only channel its answer travels through — has no field for any of those, and
:func:`queryguard.integrations.llm.reconcile_nplusone_explanation` rejects prose
that tries to smuggle one in as text instead.

Everything here is best-effort. :meth:`GroqExplanationProvider.explain_nplusone`
never raises: a missing key, a bad key, a rate limit, a timeout, a network
failure, a malformed response, or a response that fails schema validation are all
"no explanation for this candidate", never an exception that could take the
review down (CLAUDE.md invariant 5). A candidate this method has nothing to say
about is simply absent from the returned mapping, and its deterministic finding
is what the report shows.
