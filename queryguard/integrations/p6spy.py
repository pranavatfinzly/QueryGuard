"""Parse p6spy statement logs captured from a running application.

Source-level analysis proves a query sits inside a loop. Only a statement log
proves how many times it actually ran — which is why this evidence carries so
much weight in the N+1 stage.

The log format is a contract with ``queryguard-sandbox``'s ``spy.properties``::

    <epoch millis>|<elapsed ms>|<category>|<sql>

Field order and separator must stay in step with that file. SQL may itself contain
``|`` (string concatenation), so the split is bounded to three separators and the
remainder is taken verbatim as the statement.
