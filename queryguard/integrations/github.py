"""PyGithub wrapper — diff retrieval, review upsert, and comment upsert.

Three things this module owns:

- Fetching the PR diff and base/head SHAs.
- Upserting a single **idempotent, tagged** GitHub Pull Request Review — the
  product's primary output (CLAUDE.md invariant 3/4). :func:`upsert_review`
  creates, edits in place, or dismisses-and-recreates QueryGuard's own review,
  identified by :data:`REVIEW_MARKER`, with ``REQUEST_CHANGES`` when a
  blocking finding exists and ``COMMENT`` otherwise — never ``APPROVE``.
- Upserting a single **idempotent, tagged** Markdown *comment*
  (:func:`upsert_report_comment`), kept as a narrower building block some
  callers may still want; :data:`COMMENT_MARKER` and :data:`REVIEW_MARKER`
  are deliberately distinct strings, since a comment and a review are
  different GitHub objects with independent idempotency.

QueryGuard's only write actions against a pull request are its own review and
its own comment. It never pushes commits, edits files, merges, or touches
another actor's review or comment.

Keeping the token out of everything
-----------------------------------

This is the only module that handles a GitHub credential, so it is the only place
the credential can escape from. Three rules, each backed by a test in
``tests/unit/test_github_integration.py``:

1. **The token is never interpolated into anything.** It is read from
   :mod:`queryguard.config`, handed to :class:`github.Auth.Token`, and never
   touched again. It appears in no URL, no log record, and no f-string.
2. **No exception from PyGithub is re-raised as-is.** Every call is wrapped, and
   what crosses this module's boundary is a :class:`GitHubUnavailable` whose
   message QueryGuard composed: the HTTP status, the operation, and — for a
   :class:`github.GithubException.GithubException` — GitHub's own ``message``
   field. For anything else only the exception's *type name* is carried out, so
   an unfamiliar library cannot leak its own message through us.
3. **Even those are redacted.** :func:`redact` runs over every string this module
   emits, replacing anything token-shaped. It is belt-and-braces against rule 1
   being broken later, and against a token that reached the text from somewhere
   other than our own configuration.

For what it is worth, PyGithub itself already strips ``Authorization`` from the
request headers before logging them — but that is its invariant to keep, not
ours, and rules 1–3 hold whether or not it does.
