"""Anthropic client, prompts, and structured outputs.

Conventions from CLAUDE.md:

- Default model :data:`MODEL`. Use the ``anthropic`` SDK — never raw HTTP.
- Structured outputs (``output_config.format``) so findings deserialize into
  :mod:`queryguard.models.finding` without ad-hoc parsing.
- Prompt caching: keep the system prompt and rule descriptions stable and cached;
  put the per-PR diff and query set after the cache breakpoint.
- Handle ``stop_reason == "refusal"`` before reading ``response.content``.

The N+1 boundary
----------------

What reaches an explanation provider is a
:class:`~queryguard.models.nplusone.NPlusOneCandidate` — a call site, a loop, a
resolved repository type, and whatever a statement log corroborated — and what
comes back is prose. The model does not get to choose the file, the line, the
loop, the query, or the count, because
:class:`~queryguard.models.nplusone.NPlusOneExplanation` has no field in which it
could express one. That boundary — the request shape, the reconciliation that
enforces it, and the :class:`~queryguard.integrations.llm.LLMExplanationProvider`
Protocol a provider implements — is provider-neutral and lives in
:mod:`queryguard.integrations.llm` now, not here, so Claude and Groq (and anything
after them) build on exactly the same enforcement rather than each carrying its
own copy. This module re-exports the three symbols below for callers already
importing them from here; new code should prefer importing from
:mod:`queryguard.integrations.llm` directly.

Today's real implementation of that Protocol is
:class:`queryguard.integrations.groq.GroqExplanationProvider`. No Claude client is
constructed here yet: :func:`request_findings` remains unimplemented, so nothing
in this module can reach the network. A future ``ClaudeExplanationProvider``
implementing :class:`~queryguard.integrations.llm.LLMExplanationProvider` belongs
here once ``request_findings`` is real — it needs no change to the detector or to
:mod:`queryguard.integrations.llm`, only a class satisfying the same Protocol
:class:`~queryguard.integrations.groq.GroqExplanationProvider` already does.
