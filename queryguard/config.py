"""Configuration — the only module in QueryGuard that reads the environment.

Every secret and every environment-dependent value enters the process here and
nowhere else. That is a testable claim, not a convention:
``test_config.py::test_config_is_the_only_module_that_reads_the_environment``
walks the source tree and fails if any other module touches ``os.environ``.

Why one module: a token read at its point of use is a token with no single place
to audit, no single place to redact, and no way to answer "what does this process
need in order to run?" without reading everything. Centralizing it also means the
masking below is the *only* thing that has to be right for a secret to stay out
of a log line.

Secrets are :class:`~pydantic.SecretStr`, so the value is unreachable without an
explicit ``.get_secret_value()``. Leaking one becomes something you have to type
on purpose rather than something you get by interpolating a variable.
