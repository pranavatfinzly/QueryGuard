"""Connection and transaction helpers — rollback-only.

This module owns the ``BEGIN`` / ``ROLLBACK`` wrapper that every statement
executed against the reference database goes through. Pipeline modules must not
open raw cursors: the invariant is that nothing QueryGuard runs can commit, and
that only holds if there is exactly one place where transactions are managed.

This applies to ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` (which really executes the query), to HypoPG
index creation, and to any ad-hoc probing.
