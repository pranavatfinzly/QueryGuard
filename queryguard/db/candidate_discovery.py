"""Repository-wide Liquibase changelog candidate search.

The fallback :mod:`queryguard.db.discovery` deliberately does not attempt:
that module reads a fixed, small set of conventional Spring Boot
configuration locations and nothing else — see its own module docstring's
"What this module does not do". When even that fails (no configuration
declares ``db.liquibase.change-log``, or the path it declares does not
resolve to a real changelog), the alternative is not to give up — the task
this module answers is "does *some* file in this repository look like the
root of a real Liquibase changelog tree, with enough corroborating evidence
to act on it rather than guess".

This is evidence-based, not filename-based. A file that happens to be named
``changelog.xml`` is not preferred over one that is not, unless something
about its *content* — a valid ``<databaseChangeLog>`` root, being the target
of another valid changelog's ``<include>``, declaring real ``<changeSet>``
content — corroborates it. Naming is one signal among several, never
sufficient by itself; see :func:`find_changelog_candidates`.

Deliberately conservative about auto-selection. Two or more candidates with
the same, best evidence are :attr:`~queryguard.db.discovery.DiscoveryStatus.AMBIGUOUS`
— named, with their evidence, rather than guessed at — exactly the same
refusal-to-guess :mod:`queryguard.db.discovery` already applies to two
disagreeing ``application.properties`` files.

    ``paths`` is the whole repository's file list (typically
    :func:`queryguard.integrations.github.list_files_at_ref`) — filtered here
    to ``*.xml`` and capped at ``limit`` before a single byte is fetched, so a
    very large repository costs a bounded number of requests rather than one
    per XML file it happens to contain.

    A file that fails to fetch, fails to parse as XML, or does not have
    ``<databaseChangeLog>`` as its root element is not a candidate at all —
    dropped silently, the same "not found" QueryGuard already treats every
    other unreadable candidate as (see
    :mod:`queryguard.db.discovery`'s own ``_read_candidate``).

    Scoring, evidence-based rather than filename-based:

    * **Referenced by another valid changelog's ``<include>``** — the
      strongest signal available without an explicit configuration: something
      *in the repository itself* names this file as part of its schema.
    * **Declares real content** (a ``<changeSet>``, or its own ``<include>``/
      ``<includeAll>``) — a file that is Liquibase-shaped but empty is weaker
      evidence than one that actually does something.
    * **Conventional naming** (``changelog``, ``changeset``, ``db-changelog``
      in the path) — the weakest signal, never sufficient alone; a file named
      ``changelog.xml`` that is empty and unreferenced is still only LOW.

    A candidate earns :attr:`CandidateConfidence.MEDIUM` if it is referenced
    by another candidate, or if it both declares real content *and* matches a
    naming convention — two independently weak signals corroborating each
    other. Everything else that at least parses as a changelog is LOW.
