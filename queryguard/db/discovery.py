"""Automatic discovery of a Spring Boot repository's Liquibase changelog root.

Every Finzly Java/Spring Boot repository is expected to declare its schema's
entry point the same way, in ``application.properties`` (or the YAML
equivalent):

    db.liquibase.change-log=classpath:/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.xml

This module answers exactly one question — *where is the root changelog?* —
and answers it as a value, not an exception: :func:`discover_liquibase_changelog`
returns a :class:`DiscoveryResult` whose :attr:`~DiscoveryResult.status`
distinguishes "found", "no configuration says anything", "more than one
configuration disagrees", and "the key is there but empty". None of those are
failures QueryGuard cannot handle — :mod:`queryguard.cli` already knows what to
do with each, and CLAUDE.md invariant 5 (fail soft) applies here exactly as it
does to every other schema-dependent path: a repository this module cannot make
sense of gets the same silent, safe fallback QueryGuard has always had.

What this module does not do
-----------------------------

* **It does not read or interpret Liquibase XML.** Once a root changelog path
  is known, :mod:`queryguard.db.liquibase` — the existing loader — walks it.
  Duplicating that walk here would be a second schema implementation, which
  this feature is explicitly not meant to become.
* **It does not touch local disk.** A review has no guaranteed local checkout
  of the repository under analysis (CLI invocations name an arbitrary
  ``OWNER/REPO`` and ``PR`` — there is nothing to assume is checked out where
  QueryGuard happens to be running). Every read goes through an injected
  ``read`` callable — the same
  :data:`~queryguard.db.liquibase.ReadChangelogFile` shape
  :func:`~queryguard.db.liquibase.build_table_schemas_remote` already takes —
  so :mod:`queryguard.cli` can back it with a GitHub API read pinned to the
  pull request's head commit, and a test can back it with a plain dict.
* **It does not scan the repository.** Only the fixed, small set of
  conventional Spring Boot configuration locations in
  :data:`DEFAULT_CANDIDATE_PATHS` is ever read — a handful of requests, not a
  repository tree listing and not "every file whose name looks promising".
  Profile-specific files (``application-dev.properties`` and the like) are
  never among them: a profile is a runtime choice this module has no basis for
  guessing, and picking one silently would be worse than finding nothing.

Property vs. YAML, and the key itself
--------------------------------------

``db.liquibase.change-log`` is read from a ``.properties`` file with a small,
intentionally narrow line parser (:func:`_parse_properties`) — not a full Java
properties implementation, because nothing beyond comments, blank lines, and
``key=value``/``key:value`` pairs has ever been observed in an audited Finzly
configuration. The YAML form is read the same way: a narrow indentation walk
(:func:`_parse_yaml_change_log`) that understands exactly the nested-mapping
shape Spring configuration uses for this key, plus the equivalent compact
dotted-key form — not a general YAML parser. PyYAML happens to be importable in
some environments this project runs in (a transitive dependency of an *extra*
on ``fastapi``/``pydantic-settings``/``uvicorn`` that this project does not
enable), but it is not a dependency this project has declared for itself, so
this module does not rely on it being present.

The key read is exactly ``db.liquibase.change-log`` — not
``spring.liquibase.change-log``, which is Spring Boot's own Liquibase
autoconfiguration key and a different (if related) setting. Every Finzly
repository audited for this feature sets the narrower key, read by application
code rather than by Spring's autoconfiguration, so that is the one this module
looks for.
