"""Liquibase changelog -> :class:`~queryguard.pipeline.static_rules.schema.TableSchema`.

Turns a Liquibase XML changelog chain into the schema shape the static rules
already understand, so :class:`~queryguard.pipeline.static_rules.rules.unindexed_filter.UnindexedFilterRule`
can answer "does this table have an index on that column" from a repository's
real schema instead of staying silent forever.

Scope, deliberately narrow. This module interprets exactly the structured
change types the audited ``galaxy-payment-service`` changelog chain actually
uses to shape a table's columns and indexes:

* ``createTable`` (columns, and inline ``<constraints primaryKey="true"/>`` /
  ``unique="true"``)
* ``addColumn`` (same column shape as ``createTable``)
* ``createIndex``
* ``addPrimaryKey``
* ``addUniqueConstraint``
* ``dropIndex``
* ``<property>`` (for ``${name}`` substitution in column ``type`` attributes)

Everything else a changeset can contain — raw ``<sql>``/``<sqlFile>`` blocks,
``modifyDataType``, ``renameColumn``, ``dropColumn``, ``addForeignKeyConstraint``,
``<preConditions>``, ``<rollback>``, ``<comment>``, ``<modifySql>`` — is walked
over and silently ignored, on purpose. In particular:

* **Raw SQL is never interpreted as schema.** A ``CREATE INDEX`` or
  ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`` sitting inside a ``<sql>`` block is invisible
  to this loader. The audited chain has real examples of exactly this
  (``PG-56.xml`` adds three columns to ``payment`` this way, never touching
  ``<addColumn>``) — this loader will under-report those columns/indexes
  rather than guess at SQL text, matching the rest of QueryGuard's "say
  nothing rather than guess" discipline for schema-dependent rules. The
  practical consequence is a *false positive* risk (``unindexed-filter``
  firing on a column that a raw-SQL block actually indexed), never a false
  negative that hides a real problem.
* **``<preConditions>`` are ignored.** They guard against re-running a
  changeset against a database that already has its effect applied; a static
  walker building a schema from nothing has no such database, so every
  changeset's effect is applied unconditionally, in order. This matches the
  chain's own usage: 617 of 619 changesets in the audited repository use
  ``onFail="MARK_RAN"``, which only ever means "skip if already applied" —
  never "change what gets applied."
* **``<includeAll>`` is not implemented.** The audited chain never uses it —
  only ``<include file="..." relativeToChangelogFile="true"/>``. Adding it
  would be guessing at a form this loader has never had to parse correctly.
* **Changesets are not filtered by ``dbms`` or scoped by ``context``/``labels``.**
  None of the three appear at the ``<changeSet>`` level in the audited chain
  (``dbms`` only ever appears nested inside ``<modifySql>``, which this loader
  already ignores), so there is nothing here to filter on.

Order matters and is preserved. Liquibase applies changesets in the order
their changelog declares them, recursing into ``<include>`` depth-first at
the point it appears. The audited chain proves this is load-bearing, not
cosmetic: ``fedwire_iso_details``'s ``local_instrument`` index is dropped and
recreated three times across three files, and only processing them in
declared order — not alphabetically, not file-by-file in isolation —
reconstructs the real final state.

PR-aware schema (rebuild-at-head, not delta-overlay)
-----------------------------------------------------

A pull request can change the changelog tree itself — add a ``createIndex``,
drop one, add a wholly new included file. :func:`build_table_schemas_remote`
answers "what does the schema look like once this pull request's Liquibase
changes are applied" by re-walking the **complete** tree from a chosen root,
sourced from ``read`` instead of local disk, exactly as :func:`build_table_schemas`
already does for a local checkout. Given a ``read`` that fetches each file at
the pull request's head commit, this reconstructs the tree's true final state
directly — no bookkeeping of "which changesets are new" is needed, because the
existing ordered walk already resolves create → drop → recreate correctly from
nothing. That also means a modified aggregator file that reorders or edits
``<include>`` lines without introducing new changesets cannot be mistaken for
new schema changes: the walk only ever sees the changesets the head tree
actually declares, once each, never replayed as if newly introduced.

:func:`resolve_pr_changelog_touch` is the cheap gate in front of this: most
pull requests never touch the changelog tree at all, and re-fetching every
file over the network on every run would be wasteful. See its docstring for
why checking the *locally resolvable* tree cannot miss a real touch.
