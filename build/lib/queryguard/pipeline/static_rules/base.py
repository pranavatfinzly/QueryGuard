"""Stage 3 — the rule protocol and registry.

Deterministic checks over parsed query ASTs. These run before any database is
provisioned, so their findings survive a provisioning failure.

Individual rules live one-per-file under :mod:`queryguard.pipeline.static_rules.rules`
and are named after the smell they detect (``SelectStarRule``,
``LeadingWildcardLikeRule``). Each ships with fixtures: one query it must flag,
and one similar query it must not.

Rules receive a :class:`RuleContext` — a parsed sqlglot AST plus provenance and
schema — never a raw string. Parsing happens once in the engine so that a rule
cannot re-parse with a different dialect, and so an unparseable query is recorded
as unanalyzable in exactly one place.
