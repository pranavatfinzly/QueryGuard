#: ``Expression``. sqlglot's ``find_all`` is generic in the types passed to it, and
#: with several it resolves to their nearest common base — ``Condition``, which sits
#: beside ``Expression`` rather than under it and declares no ``args``. Every node
#: matched here is an ``Expression`` at runtime; this is what says so statically.

    established from the query text alone, and a rule that guessed would fire on
