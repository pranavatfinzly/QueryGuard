"""Stage 2 — Extract query candidates with source provenance.

The stage's contract is :func:`extract_source`: one
:class:`~queryguard.models.query.SourceFile` in, ``list[ExtractedQuery]`` out,
whatever language the file is written in. Everything else exported here is
either a language implementation or a narrower entry point kept for callers that
predate the contract.

To add a language: implement :class:`~queryguard.pipeline.extract.base.Extractor`
and call :func:`register_extractor`. Nothing in this package, and nothing
downstream of it, needs to change.
