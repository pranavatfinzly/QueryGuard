"""Stage 2 — the extension registry that decides which extractor sees a file.

A registry rather than a conditional in the dispatcher, so that adding Kotlin,
Python, or a Micronaut variant is a registration and a new module instead of an
edit to the code that routes to them. The dispatcher then holds no knowledge of
which languages exist, which is the only way its behaviour can stay fixed while
the set of languages grows.
