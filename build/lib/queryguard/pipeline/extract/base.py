"""Stage 2 — the extraction contract every source language implements.

One protocol, one input model, one output model. A new language is a new class
satisfying :class:`Extractor` plus one :meth:`registration
<queryguard.pipeline.extract.registry.ExtractorRegistry.register>` call; no
module downstream of extraction changes, and no module upstream of it learns a
new name. That is the "open for extension, closed for modification" property the
extract stage is meant to have, expressed as a type rather than as a convention.

The input is a :class:`~queryguard.models.query.SourceFile` rather than a
``(path, content)`` pair on purpose. A pair cannot carry per-source options, and
the moment one language needs one — SQL already does, in ``SqlSource.dialect`` —
the choice is to widen every extractor's signature or to smuggle the option past
the contract. The first breaks every implementation for one language's benefit;
the second is how ``SqlSource.dialect`` came to be a public field that nothing
read. A model subtype carries the option to the extractor that understands it and
stays invisible to the ones that do not.
