"""Stage 7 — N+1 detection.

Reasons *across* the diff rather than within one query: a repository call inside a
loop, a lazy association dereferenced per row, the same statement re-issued once
per element. No single-query rule can see any of these, which is why this is a
stage of its own and not a
:class:`~queryguard.pipeline.static_rules.base.Rule` — a rule receives one parsed
query and nothing else, by design, and widening that contract for one check would
cost every other rule its simplicity.

The evidence comes from three places, and keeping them distinct is most of the
value here:

* **Structure**, from :mod:`queryguard.pipeline.extract.java_structure` — which
  identifier holds a repository, which construct repeats, what flows into the
  arguments. Facts about source text.
* **Declarations**, from the extract stage — the JPQL, native SQL, or derived
  method a call site resolves to, so the report can quote the query rather than
  just name a method.
* **Execution**, from :mod:`queryguard.integrations.p6spy` when a run captured a
  statement log. This is the only input that can say something *ran*.

A finding never presents the first two as though they were the third. Source
analysis proves a call sits inside a loop; it cannot prove the loop iterates more
than once, that the collection is not empty, or that a cache does not absorb the
repeat. So the default title is "Potential N+1 query pattern", and the wording
strengthens only where a statement log actually corroborates it — the same
discipline CLAUDE.md applies to unverifiable LLM claims, applied to our own.

Detection is deterministic and does not depend on a model: every candidate,
tier, and rendered :class:`Finding` below is decided before an
:class:`~queryguard.integrations.llm.LLMExplanationProvider` is ever consulted,
and nothing about *whether* a pattern is reported changes if one is absent. An
optional provider — Groq today, via
:class:`~queryguard.integrations.groq.GroqExplanationProvider` — may be supplied
to enrich the rendered findings with prose; when it is, the model describes
evidence that already exists rather than deciding what the evidence is, and its
prose is reconciled against that evidence by
:func:`queryguard.integrations.llm.reconcile_nplusone_explanation` before it can
reach a finding. A caller that supplies no provider gets exactly the report this
module has always produced.
