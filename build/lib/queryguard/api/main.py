"""QueryGuard FastAPI service.

Run locally::

    uvicorn queryguard.api.main:app --reload

Endpoints:

- ``GET  /health``  — liveness probe.
- ``POST /analyze`` — run the review pipeline over the SQL in a pull request.

The route validates the request, hands it to
:class:`~queryguard.pipeline.runner.AnalysisRunner`, and shapes the response. The
ordering of the stages and their failure handling belong to the runner, so this
module holds no analysis logic.
