"""Snapshot tests for the PR comment body.

The comment format is user-facing, so it is pinned byte for byte: a change to it
is a change a reviewer sees on every pull request, and it should have to be
approved deliberately rather than arriving as a side effect.

The reports here are built by hand rather than driven through the rule engine.
Snapshotting real rule output would mean that editing one rule's explanation
breaks the renderer's snapshot, which tests nothing about rendering — the rule
suites already pin their own text.

To regenerate after an intended format change::
