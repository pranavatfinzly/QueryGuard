"""Stage 2 (SQL) — statement splitting, provenance, and malformed input.

The extract stage had no tests of its own, which is the worst place in this pipeline
for a gap: every finding's ``file:line`` anchor and every quoted snippet in the PR
comment comes from here. A rule that fires correctly on the wrong line, or quotes SQL
the author never wrote, is a bug a reviewer blames the whole tool for.

Three defects these tests were written against, all of the same shape — ``spans`` and
``statements`` are computed by two different sqlglot passes, and pairing them by
position desynchronizes as soon as a segment appears in one but not the other:

* a stray ``;`` gave every following statement the previous statement's text and line
* a comment-only segment did the same *and* surfaced the comment as a query
* a UTF-8 BOM made the entire file unanalyzable
