"""Tests for the pipeline orchestrator.

The endpoint tests cover what a caller sees. These cover the contracts the runner
owns and the HTTP surface cannot show: that each stage fails soft into a named
degradation, and that the rule engine is driven exactly once over the whole query
set rather than once per source or once per rule.
