"""Cross-stage test: sandbox planted bug -> extract -> RuleEngine -> Findings.

This is the first test that runs two pipeline stages together, and the first to
assert QueryGuard actually catches what the sandbox was built to trip.

It lives under ``unit/`` rather than ``integration/`` on purpose: in this repo
``integration`` means "requires Docker" (see the marker in ``pytest.ini``), and this
path needs no database — the whole point of the static stage is that it runs before
anything is provisioned.

The SQL is not retyped from memory. Each string is asserted to appear verbatim in
the sandbox source it came from, so if a planted bug is edited or "fixed", this test
fails rather than silently testing SQL the sandbox no longer contains.
