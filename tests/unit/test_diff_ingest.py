"""Stage 1 — reading a pull request's diff into sources.

Two halves. The first is patch parsing, tested against hand-written unified diffs
because the interesting inputs are the malformed ones a real PR will not supply.
The second is :func:`build_sources`, tested against the **recorded** pull request
in ``tests/fixtures/diffs/`` — a real GitHub payload from a real PR, carrying one
file per case this stage has to get right.

Nothing here opens a socket.
