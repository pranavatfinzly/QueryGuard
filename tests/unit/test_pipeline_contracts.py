"""Cross-cutting invariants of the static pipeline.

The stage tests ask "does this rule fire". These ask the questions that only show up
once the stages are assembled and put under load:

* is the output **deterministic** — the same diff twice must not produce two
  different PR comments, or reviewers stop believing the tool
* is it **safe to share** — one ``AnalysisRunner`` serves concurrent requests from
  FastAPI's threadpool
* does it **serialize losslessly** — the report crosses an HTTP boundary and will
  later cross a Markdown renderer
* is it **internally consistent** — every finding must point at a query that is
  actually in the report, at the line that query actually came from
