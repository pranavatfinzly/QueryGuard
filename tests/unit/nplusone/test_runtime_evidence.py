"""p6spy corroboration, and the line between observed and inferred.

A statement log is the only input that can say something *ran*. These tests pin
both directions of that: it must strengthen a matching structural pattern, and it
must never be allowed to manufacture certainty where the log does not actually
support it — including the case p6spy's own grouping was built to expose, where a
shape repeats with identical bind values and is a caching problem rather than an
N+1.
