"""Targeted retrieval of repository interfaces the pull request did not change.

This is the seam that makes real pull requests work: most of them edit a call site
and leave the repository alone. These tests cover the CLI-side resolver — that it
asks for the right path, asks once, and degrades quietly — using the recorded
GitHub fixture, so nothing here touches the network.
