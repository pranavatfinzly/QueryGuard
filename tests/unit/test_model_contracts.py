"""Tests for the properties every stage contract has by virtue of its base.

The pipeline is a chain of stages over a shared set of queries and findings. A
stage that could edit its input would produce a report describing something no
file ever contained, with nothing anywhere to say it happened. These tests pin
the guarantee that stops it.
