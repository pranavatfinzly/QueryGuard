### Blocking findings

#### 🔴 Critical

#### `UPDATE` rewrites every row: no `WHERE` clause

**Where:** `migrations/003_customers.sql:4`

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET loyalty_tier = 'gold'
```

This UPDATE has no WHERE clause, so it matches every row in `customers` rather than a subset.

**Impact:** Every row in the table is rewritten, and the previous values are gone. On a table this size that is both a long write and an unrecoverable one without a restore.

**Suggested fix:** Scope the write to the rows it is meant to touch. If it really is every row, say so explicitly in the migration's comment so the next reader does not have to guess.

```sql
UPDATE customers SET loyalty_tier = 'gold' WHERE lifetime_value >= 1000;
```

### Warnings

#### 🟡 Medium

#### Query selects every column with `SELECT *`

**Where:** `migrations/001_orders.sql:12`

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
```

The projection is `*`, so the query returns every column of every row it matches, including ones the caller never reads.

**Impact:** Every added column silently widens this query's result set, so a schema change elsewhere makes it slower with no change to this file.

**Suggested fix:** Name the columns the caller actually uses.
