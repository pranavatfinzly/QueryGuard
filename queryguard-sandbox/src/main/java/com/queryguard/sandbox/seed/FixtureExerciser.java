/**
 * Executes the read-path fixtures so they appear in the p6spy statement log.
 *
 * <p>QueryGuard's N+1 stage corroborates a source-level finding against the
 * statements a real run actually issued. That log is empty unless something calls
 * the fixtures — analysing the source proves the loop exists, but only running it
 * proves the query count. This runner is that call site.
 *
 * <p>Off by default: seeding is the normal reason to boot this app, and a full
 * exercise pass issues one query per seeded customer. Enable with
 * {@code sandbox.exercise-fixtures=true}.
 *
 * <p>Read-path only. The {@code UPDATE}-without-{@code WHERE} fixture is
 * deliberately excluded — it stays behind {@code MaintenanceService}'s own guard
 * and is never executed by any automated path.
